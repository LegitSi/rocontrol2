RoControl, but better!

Now that I have your attention, Mr. Tactical, I'd like to ask you some questions.
1. What's your *real* age? We know you're capping because if you were really such a prodigy, you wouldn't waste your brainpower on script building.
2. Who is exactly campaigning for RoControl to be taken down? And how come I've never heard any of their cries before? Surely one of them must of contacted me at some point. It's not that hard to get in touch with me, except for someone like you.
3. Do you even know what RoControl is? Seriously, I'd really like to know a detailed description of what you think it is.

But enough of that, you probably want to hear from me first, so let me answer some questions you might have.
1. Who the hell am I? My name's LegitSi, I'm a perpetual netizen that, among many things, made RoControl. It was an idea that I had that spiraled out of my control.
2. Why did you make RoControl? Simple. I wanted to use it for moderation purposes for my later Roblox games, not that I ever made any..

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, say them to my face.
